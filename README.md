## Flash_Programmer

The SPI flash memory progammer, is implemented using TI's TivaC embedded board Currently, only EN25Q32B SPI flash memory is supported. The flash driver is implemented in `'flash.c'`. The `'imem.c'` contains the user program that is written to the SPI flash memory. See the demo [examples] (https://github.com/ee-uet/UETRV_ESoC) to generate the `'imem.c'`.
